## Request: Formal Recognition of VI Guide Status

### Current State
**Documents:** 
- IFSC Statutes (2025), Section 20 - Definitions
- IFSC Rules 2025, Section 2 - Definitions
- IFSC Uniform Code (2025), Section 2.1
- Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B §4.6, §4.9
- Awards Ceremony Protocol
- IFSC Results Website (ifsc-climbing.org/results)

**Current Definitions:**
> **IFSC Statutes §20:** Defines "Athletes Commission," "Technical Officials," and various other roles but contains no definition for VI guides/sight guides.
>
> **IFSC Rules 2025 §2:** States "The terms athlete, climber and competitor are used interchangeably" but provides no category for VI guides.
>
> **Uniform Code §2.1:** "Team members must wear the uniform of their member federation" - covers athletes and team officials but does NOT explicitly include VI guides.
>
> **Competition Regs Annex B §4.6:** "The Final round should be preceded by a presentation of the finalists" - mentions only athletes, with no provision for VI guides.
>
> **Competition Regs Annex B §4.9:** Refers to guides only as "Team officials designated as sight guides" - treating them as a subset of team officials rather than a distinct category.

**Problem:** VI guides currently have no formally defined status within the IFSC framework. They are loosely categorised as "team officials" but this does not reflect their unique role:
- They are NOT athletes (they do not compete independently)
- They are NOT coaches (they do not train or strategise from the sideline)
- They ARE essential performance partners who directly contribute to competition results

This lack of formal status creates multiple issues:
1. No IFSC profile on the results website
2. No recognition at awards ceremonies - guides do not receive medals despite being part of the performance partnership
3. No formal introduction to audiences during finals presentations
4. Ambiguous uniform requirements
5. No recognition in world rankings or competition records

The partnership nature of B1, B2, and B3 Sport Class climbing requires that VI guides be treated as part of a "team" with their athlete, similar to pilot-guide partnerships in Paralympic cycling or tandem events in other sports.

### Required Updates

**1. Amend IFSC Rules 2025, Section 2 (Definitions) - Add new definition:**

> **Sight Guide** means an individual designated to provide verbal guidance and direction to a competitor in the B1, B2, or B3 Sport Classes. Sight Guides must be of the same nationality as the athlete they guide. For B1, B2, and B3 Sport Classes, competition results are attributed to the athlete-guide partnership.

**2. Amend IFSC Uniform Code, Section 2 (General) - Add new section 2.7:**

> **2.7** Sight Guides for athletes competing in the B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes must comply with the uniform requirements set out in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this code when accompanying athletes in the Competition Area, Call Zone, Field of Play, or during any ceremony.

**3. Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 4.6:**

> **4.6** The Final round should be preceded by a presentation of the finalists. **For B1, B2 and B3 Sport Classes, the presentation shall include both the athlete and their designated Sight Guide, recognising the partnership nature of visually impaired climbing.**

**4. Amend Awards Ceremony Protocol, Section 6 (Procedure) - Add provision for VI partnerships:**

> For events including B1, B2, or B3 Sport Classes, the Awards Ceremony shall recognise the athlete-guide partnership. Both the athlete and their designated Sight Guide shall:
> - March in together to the Awards Ceremony
> - Be announced together by the speaker (e.g., "[Athlete Name] with guide [Guide Name], representing [Country]")
> - Receive medals together on the podium
> - Be photographed together as medallists

**5. Amend IFSC World Ranking Para Climbing - Add guide recognition:**

> For B1, B2, and B3 Sport Classes, world ranking records shall display both the athlete name and the name of the Sight Guide who partnered with them for each result.

**6. Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B §4.9:**

> **4.9** Sight Guides for athletes competing in the B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes are allowed to take part in any collective observation period for those sport classes. Sight Guides must be individually paired with athletes for each round. i.e., they cannot guide multiple athletes where a route is attempted on-sight.
>
> **4.9.1** Sight Guides shall be registered with the IFSC and assigned a unique identifier for results tracking purposes. Guide registrations shall be linked to the athlete(s) they partner with for each competition.

**7. Amend IFSC Results/Database System - Add guide profiles:**

> The IFSC results system shall include profiles for registered Sight Guides of athletes competing in B1, B2, and B3 Sport Classes. Guide profiles shall include:
> - Guide name and nationality
> - Competition history linked to the athlete(s) they have guided
> - Results achieved as part of athlete-guide partnerships
> 
> Guide profiles shall be linked to athlete profiles to reflect the partnership, with results credited to both athlete and guide.
