**Date:** December 3, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Frederik Leys, Athlete Representatives

## Overview

This document consolidates rule change requests from VI (Visually Impaired) athletes that specifically impact the **IFSC Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025**. These requests are submitted for consideration by the Event Commission.

## Note on Sight Guide Requests

All requests concerning Sight Guides (finalist presentation including guides, guide registration and pairing requirements) have been consolidated in a separate document: **VI_Guide_statute.md**

## Request 1: Route Preview Video Timing for Para Climbing Events

### Current State
**Document:** Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 4.7

> "If route is to be attempted flash, a route demonstration will be made available at least 60 minutes prior to the scheduled Start of Play either as a video recording made available for individual download/streaming (or as an alternative, continuously played back in the warm-up area) or where video recordings cannot be provided, as a live demonstration."

### Problem
The route reading videos often come out late in the evening or night before qualifications. While these videos allow climbers to study the climbing route, this is particularly challenging for VI athletes who must review routes together with their callers/guides. This coordination requires additional time and is difficult to arrange when videos are only released late at night.

Specific challenges include:

1. **Early morning starts:** Para climbing qualification rounds are often scheduled in the morning
2. **Partnership preparation:** VI athletes need to review routes together with their guides, which requires coordinating schedules and is impractical late at night
3. **Inconsistent timing:** Videos released at random times create uncertainty for all athletes and make preparation difficult

The current 60-minute minimum prior to Start of Play is insufficient, particularly for VI athletes who need to coordinate with their guides.

### Required Update
**Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 4.7:**

> **4.7** If route is to be attempted flash, a route demonstration will be made available either as a video recording made available for individual download/streaming (or as an alternative, continuously played back in the warm-up area) or where video recordings cannot be provided, as a live demonstration.
>
> **4.7.1** Route preview videos shall be made available:
> - **For rounds with a scheduled Start of Play before 12:00, route preview videos shall be made available no later than 22:00 (10pm) on the evening prior to competition.**
> - **For rounds with a scheduled Start of Play at 12:00 or later, route preview videos shall be made available at least 2 hours prior to the scheduled Start of Play.**

## Request 2: Clock Positioning for VI Guides

### Current State
**Document:** Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 6.1

> "A timing system should be used in the final rounds to display, for both the public and competitors, the remaining time in the collective or individual observation/preparation periods, as well as the remaining climbing time."

### Problem
Clock positioning only mentions "public and competitors." VI guides need to see timing while guiding but current clocks face the wall (for sighted climbers looking down). No provision for guide visibility.

### Required Update
**Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 6 - Add new section 6.2:**

> **6.2** For events including B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes, a secondary timing display shall be positioned at the base of the climbing wall, oriented toward the competition floor, allowing sight guides to monitor remaining climbing time from their guiding position. This display must be synchronized with the primary timing system.

## Request 3: Accessible Document Formats for VI Athletes

### Current State
**Document:** Various IFSC Official Documents (Rules, Regulations, Guidelines)

> All official IFSC documents are distributed exclusively in PDF format via the IFSC website.

### Problem
PDF documents are not optimized for screen readers, which are the primary tool VI climbers use to access written information. Current PDFs often lack proper heading structure, alt text for images, tagged content, and reading order—making them difficult or impossible for athletes in B1, B2, and B3 Sport Classes to independently review competition rules, classification requirements, and event information.

### Required Update
**Amend IFSC Communications/Publications Policy - Add accessibility requirement:**

> All official IFSC documents intended for athlete use shall be made available in accessible formats alongside the standard PDF version. This includes:
> - Tagged PDF documents with proper reading order and heading structure
> - Alternative formats such as accessible HTML or plain text versions
> - Images and diagrams shall include descriptive alt text
> 
> The IFSC shall ensure that new documents meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards prior to publication.

**Note:** This request may fall under IFSC Office (Secretary General) + Communications rather than Event Commission, but is included here as it directly impacts VI athlete preparation for events.

## Rationale

These changes to the Competition Regulations would:
1. **Improve preparation equity** - VI athletes and their guides can adequately prepare when routes are scheduled early
2. **Enable partnership coordination** - Allows time for athlete-guide route review sessions
3. **Provide consistency** - All athletes benefit from predictable video release schedules
4. **Improve competition safety and fairness** - Guides can monitor time effectively during climbs
5. **Enable independent access** - VI athletes can review competition documents using screen readers
