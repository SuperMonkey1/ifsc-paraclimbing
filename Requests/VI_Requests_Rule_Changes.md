# VI Climber Requests - Rule Changes Required

**Date:** November 30, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Frederik Leys, Para Climber Athlete Representative

## Request 1: VI Guide Uniform Requirements

### Current State
**Document:** IFSC Uniform Code (2025), Section 2.1

> "Team members must wear the uniform of their member federation when representing their member federation in public during the course of a competition."

**Problem:** "Team members" covers athletes and team officials but does NOT explicitly include VI guides (sight guides). Guides are referenced in Competition Regulations §4.2 and Annex B §4.9 as "team officials designated as sight guides" but have no specific uniform requirements.

### Required Update
**Amend IFSC Uniform Code, Section 2 (General) - Add new section 2.7:**

> **2.7** Team officials designated as sight guides for athletes competing in the B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes must comply with the uniform requirements set out in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this code when accompanying athletes in the Competition Area, Call Zone, Field of Play, or during any ceremony.

**Jurisdiction:** Rules Commission (Chair: Timothy Hatch) → Executive Board

## Request 2: Clock Positioning for VI Guides

### Current State
**Document:** Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 6.1

> "A timing system should be used in the final rounds to display, for both the public and competitors, the remaining time in the collective or individual observation/preparation periods, as well as the remaining climbing time."

**Problem:** Clock positioning only mentions "public and competitors." VI guides need to see timing while guiding but current clocks face the wall (for sighted climbers looking down). No provision for guide visibility.

### Required Update
**Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 6 - Add new section 6.2:**

> **6.2** For events including B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes, a secondary timing display shall be positioned at the base of the climbing wall, oriented toward the competition floor, allowing sight guides to monitor remaining climbing time from their guiding position. This display must be synchronized with the primary timing system.

**Jurisdiction:** Events Commission (Chair: Marc Norman) + Rules Commission → Executive Board

## Request 3: Finals Introductions with VI Guides

### Current State
**Document:** Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 4.6

> "The Final round should be preceded by a presentation of the finalists."

**Problem:** Only mentions "finalists" (athletes). No provision for VI guides to be included in presentation despite the partnership nature of VI climbing. Guides referenced separately in §4.9 for observation periods only.

### Required Update
**Amend Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events 2025, Annex B, Section 4.6:**

> **4.6** The Final round should be preceded by a presentation of the finalists. **For B1, B2 and B3 Sport Classes, the presentation shall include both the athlete and their designated sight guide, recognizing the partnership nature of visually impaired climbing.**

**Jurisdiction:** Events Commission (Chair: Marc Norman) → Executive Board
