TODO
- extra paraclimbing section in 
- guide status
    - Sian: I agree with Aristote. They should be given medals as their role is integral to performance, it is a partnership. And as such I would consider them an athlete partner. This is consistent with the new regulations regarding each athlete having their own guide and recognising this partnership above the necessity of this regulation for iso compliance.
    - aristotle: see email (want athlete, but discussed in person later, want equal treatment)

- do we adress the GA directly? "reports directly to the GA on specific proposals."
