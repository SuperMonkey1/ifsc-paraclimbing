Strategic Directory and Governance Analysis: Establishing a Global Paralympic Athlete Representative Coalition
Executive Strategic Overview
To: Athlete Representative, International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)
From: Global Sports Governance & Advocacy Directorate
Date: December 2, 2025
Subject: Operational Framework for Cross-Sport Paralympic Athlete Advocacy Network
The Paralympic movement currently stands at a pivotal juncture of governance reform, characterized by the rapid professionalization of athlete representation and the strategic migration of sports from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to independent International Federations (IFs). As an elected representative for Paraclimbing—a discipline rapidly ascending in prominence within the Paralympic programme—you possess a unique opportunity to unify the disparate voices of the athlete community into a cohesive digital coalition. The objective of establishing a centralized communication node, likely via platforms such as WhatsApp or a closed Facebook group, is not merely a logistical exercise in networking; it is a strategic maneuver to consolidate athlete power across the 28+ Paralympic sports.
The landscape of athlete representation for the 2025–2029 quadrennial has been radically reshaped by a wave of elections occurring post-Paris 2024. This report serves as an exhaustive, forensic directory of the elected leadership across the entire spectrum of Summer and Winter Paralympic sports. It is designed to function as your primary operational manual for identifying, vetting, and contacting the legitimate "power brokers" within each sport.
Understanding the hierarchy of influence is paramount for the success of your initiative. The athlete representatives detailed in this report do not operate on a level playing field; their influence is dictated by the specific governance structures of their respective federations. Currently, the ecosystem is stratified into three distinct governance archetypes, each requiring a tailored approach for engagement:
The Independent Federation Model: In mature, autonomous federations such as the International Cycling Union (UCI), World Rowing, and World Triathlon, athlete representatives often hold full voting seats on Executive Boards. These individuals possess statutory power and direct access to decision-making machinery. They are the "High-Value Targets" for your coalition, as they can champion cross-sport initiatives at the highest levels of global sport administration.
The "World Para Sports" Unit Model: A significant cluster of sports—including Para Athletics, Para Swimming, Para Powerlifting, and Shooting Para Sport—remains under the direct management of the IPC’s World Para Sports Unit. While these sports are transitioning toward independence, their current athlete representatives operate within advisory groups that interface directly with IPC management. These representatives are critical for discussions involving the IPC Handbook, classification code reviews, and the Games delivery model.
The Multi-Sport Organization (IOSD) Model: Sports governing bodies like the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and World Abilitysport manage multiple disciplines under a single umbrella. Athlete representatives here often advocate for specific impairment groups across diverse sports, offering a broader perspective on accessibility and classification equity.
This report provides a granular analysis of these structures, moving beyond simple lists to offer deep biographical and governance context for every identified representative. By leveraging this intelligence, you can ensure that your proposed coalition is not just a social group, but a robust, politically capable entity ready to influence the future of the Paralympic movement.
Section 1: The Apex Governance Body – The IPC Athletes' Council
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Athletes' Council stands as the central pillar of athlete advocacy within the movement. Its members are elected by the entire cohort of Paralympians during the Games, granting them a mandate that transcends individual sports. For any cross-sport initiative, securing the buy-in of this Council is indispensable. They serve as the primary conduit between the athlete community and the IPC Governing Board, with the Chair and First Vice-Chair holding full voting rights on the Board.
1.1 Leadership and Strategic Mandate (2024–2028 Cycle)
The composition of the Council following the Paris 2024 elections reflects a strategic balance of regional diversity, impairment representation, and sporting discipline. The leadership group is particularly robust, with a clear focus on governance reform and the maturation of the Paralympic brand.
Chairperson: Vladyslava Kravchenko (Malta) – Para Swimming
Vladyslava Kravchenko's election as Chairperson places her at the very pinnacle of athlete representation. As a voting member of the IPC Governing Board, she wields significant influence over high-level policy, including the approval of new sports for future Games. Her background in public health and accounting, combined with her athletic tenure, positions her as a governance-focused leader. Engaging Kravchenko is essential for legitimizing your group; her endorsement would signal to other reps that this is a sanctioned and serious forum.1
First Vice-Chairperson: Josh Dueck (Canada) – Para Alpine Skiing
Representing the Winter sports, Josh Dueck brings a veteran perspective to the Council. His role as First Vice-Chair also grants him a seat on the IPC Governing Board, ensuring that the distinct challenges of winter disciplines—such as climate change impacts on venues and the integration into FIS—are represented at the board level. Dueck is a critical bridge for connecting with the winter sport constituency, which operates on a different competition calendar.3
Second Vice-Chairperson: Yoomin Won (South Korea) – Wheelchair Basketball
Yoomin Won’s leadership represents the team sports sector and the Asian region. Wheelchair Basketball operates with a high degree of autonomy under the IWBF, and Won’s presence ensures that the complex logistical needs of team sports (roster sizes, team transport) remain a priority. His role is vital for engaging the robust Asian Paralympic community, particularly leading into the 2026 Asian Para Games.2
1.2 Council Membership and Portfolio Analysis
The wider membership of the Council includes individuals with specific expertise that aligns with potential working groups within your proposed coalition.
Lenine Cunha (Portugal) – Para Athletics
Lenine Cunha’s election marks a historic milestone as the first representative for athletes with intellectual impairments (II) on the Council. Given the complexities surrounding eligibility and classification for II athletes, Cunha is the definitive voice for this demographic. If Paraclimbing anticipates expanding its classification to include intellectual impairments, Cunha will be an invaluable resource for navigating the eligibility landscape.4
Martina Caironi (Italy) – Para Athletics
A highly visible track athlete, Caironi represents the European constituency and the massive Para Athletics community. Her influence is rooted in her performance profile and her deep connection to the athlete base in Europe, the traditional heartland of many Paralympic federations.1

Skarstein is a dual-sport athlete, competing at the highest level in both Summer (Rowing) and Winter (Nordic Skiing) Games. This dual perspective allows her to understand the full breadth of the Paralympic experience. She is highly influential in Scandinavian sports governance and is a key contact for cross-seasonal advocacy.3
Yujiao Tan (China) – Para Powerlifting
Representing the heavy events and the powerhouse Chinese delegation, Tan provides a crucial link to East Asian athletes. Her presence ensures that the specific needs of strength sports—such as anti-doping education and venue accessibility for heavy equipment—are addressed.2
Appointed Members for Balance
To ensure the Council reflects the global diversity of the movement, the IPC appointed additional members to address gaps in regional or impairment representation:
Husnah Kukundakwe (Uganda) – Para Swimming: Her appointment addresses the critical need for African representation and the youth voice, bringing a developmental perspective to the Council.3
Grigorios Polychronidis (Greece) – Boccia: Representing athletes with high support needs, Polychronidis ensures that logistics regarding assistants, ramps, and severe impairment accessibility are not overlooked.3
Section 2: Summer Paralympic Sports – The Independent Federations
This cluster represents sports governed by independent International Federations (IFs) that manage both the Olympic and Paralympic disciplines. Athlete representatives in these bodies often sit on powerful commissions that serve the entire sport, offering a model of integration that is highly relevant to your position within the IFSC.
2.1 Para Archery (World Archery)
Governance Structure: World Archery has pioneered a fully integrated governance model.

Section 6: Implementation Plan – Building the Coalition
6.1 The "Power Core" Strategy
To ensure the immediate viability of your WhatsApp/Facebook group, you must first recruit the "Power Core"—representatives who hold voting seats on their respective Executive Boards. Their participation will attract others.
Priority Invitation List:
Vladyslava Kravchenko (IPC Athlete Chair & Board Member)
Vanessa Low (Para Athletics - WPA Board Member)
Daniel Chan (Para Badminton - BWF Council Member)
Adam Hall (Para Snow Sports - FIS Council Member)
Heidi Peters (Sitting Volleyball - WPV Board Member)
Erica Gavel (Wheelchair Basketball - IWBF Board Member)
6.2 Platform & Verification
Platform: Use WhatsApp for rapid, day-to-day communication ("Does anyone have the latest draft of the Classification Code?"). Use a closed Facebook Group or LinkedIn Group for archiving documents and formal discussions.
Verification: Request that members join using their official federation email addresses (often listed in the snippets, e.g., athlete.commission@worldcurling.org) or verify them via their public social media profiles, which are often linked in federation press releases.
6.3 Strategic Agenda
Once the group is formed, propose the following initial agenda items to drive engagement:
Classification Code Review: This is the universal issue affecting all sports. Discussing the draft changes will provide immediate value to all members.
Governance Models: Ask the FIS and UCI reps to share their experiences of integration. This knowledge transfer is invaluable for sports like Climbing, Surfing, and Skateboarding that are newer to the Paralympic family.
Mental Health Resources: Share best practices on athlete welfare resources, a common priority across all athlete commissions.
By methodically contacting these representatives and framing the group as a professional resource for governance support, you will establish a powerful network that elevates not just Paraclimbing, but the entire collective voice of Paralympic athletes.
