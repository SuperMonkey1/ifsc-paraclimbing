### **Key Points on IFSC Structure and Change Processes**

* The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) is governed by its Executive Board, which approves major proposals, including rule changes, with input from commissions and athletes. Research suggests that commissions, such as Para-Climbing and Rules, play a central role in recommending modifications, often involving athlete representatives.  
* Athlete representatives, like those in the Para-Climbing Commission, provide direct input on issues affecting para climbers, including rules, classification, and representation. It seems likely that changes are initiated through these commissions, with escalation to the Executive Board for approval.  
* For rule changes, proposals stem from stakeholder analyses and are developed collaboratively by technical commissions, athletes, and others before board approval; updates occur biennially or as needed, with 2025 introducing scoring and format adjustments.  
* Classification in para climbing involves medical documentation review by classifiers, leading to sport class assignment; appeals and protests align with international standards, but specific proposal mechanisms for systemic changes are channeled through the Classification Commission.  
* To implement changes, approach relevant commission chairs or members first, such as Sian Spencer for Para-Climbing and Classification, then escalate to the Executive Board if needed; athlete reps ensure para climbers' voices are heard in governance.

### **Approaching the IFSC**

As an athlete representative, start by contacting the relevant commission via the IFSC's contact page or directly emailing commission chairs listed on their pages. For para-specific issues, engage the Para-Climbing Commission first, which includes athlete reps like Frederik Leys and Hannah Zook. Use formal channels, such as submitting proposals during commission meetings or through national federations.

### **Implementing Rule Changes**

Rule updates are proposed via commissions like the Rules Commission (chaired by Timothy Hatch), involving athlete input, and approved by the Executive Board. For 2025, changes include a point-based scoring system and more semi-finalists in boulder events. Submit ideas in writing, backed by stakeholder feedback, for review in biennial cycles.

### **Handling Classification Changes**

Submit medical forms for individual classifications; for broader changes, propose via the Classification Commission (chaired by Mark Fisher), which reviews and assigns classes based on IPC-aligned impairments. Appeals occur during competitions, with athlete rep Corinna Wimmer available for support.

### **Ensuring Athlete Representation**

The Governance Commission (chaired by Sarah Umbricht) advises on structure, including commission compositions that mandate athlete reps. Propose structural changes through this commission or the Athletes' Commission to enhance para climber voices.

The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) serves as the global governing body for sport climbing, including para climbing, overseeing competitions, rules, and athlete development. Its structure emphasizes collaborative governance, with key bodies working together to manage changes in rules, classifications, and representation. The Executive Board holds ultimate approval authority for major decisions, such as rule modifications, drawing on recommendations from specialized commissions. These commissions, established under the IFSC Statutes, operate under approved Terms of Reference and include athlete representatives to ensure inclusivity.

In terms of approaching the IFSC, the process begins with identifying the appropriate commission based on the issue. For para climbing matters, the Para-Climbing Commission is the primary entry point, chaired by Sian Spencer (Australia), with members from various nations including Raphael Nishimura (Brazil), Aristotelis Liontos (France), and others, all serving mandates from 2025-2029. This commission promotes para climbing growth and represents its interests, incorporating athlete reps Frederik Leys (Belgium, 2023-2027) and Hannah Zook (USA, 2025-2029). To initiate contact, use the IFSC's general contact form or email addresses listed on commission pages, providing detailed proposals supported by athlete feedback.

For implementing changes requested by para climbing athletes, the pathway varies by type. Rule changes, for instance, are handled by the Rules Commission, chaired by Timothy Hatch (Great Britain), with members like Ying Cheng (China) and athlete reps Julia Fiser (Austria) and Ievgeniia Kazbekova (Ukraine). Proposals arise from stakeholder analyses, such as SWOT reviews started in 2022, involving technical commissions, media teams, and athletes. Once developed, they are submitted to the Executive Board for approval, as seen in the 2025 updates that introduced a simplified point-based scoring (25 for tops, 10 for zones, minus 0.1 per attempt) and increased semi-finalists to 24 in boulder events for better viewer engagement. Athletes or reps can submit ideas via commission meetings or formal petitions, with regulations allowing amendments based on participant demands, published biennially.

Classification changes follow a structured, medical-based process aligned with International Paralympic Committee (IPC) standards. Athletes submit standardized medical forms in English, signed by a doctor, categorizing impairments into nine eligible types (e.g., impaired muscle power, vision impairment). A panel of classifiers reviews documentation pre-competition, assigning Sport Classes with statuses like New (N), Review (R), or Confirmed (C). Evaluation sessions during events include interviews and tests, mandatory for N or R statuses. Appeals and protests adhere to IPC timing, occurring at competitions with results delayed if needed for panel input. The Classification Commission, chaired by Mark Fisher (USA) and including Head of Classification Sian Spencer, handles systemic changes; proposals from reps like Corinna Wimmer (Germany) can be raised in meetings to refine categories or processes. Recent master lists are updated as of September 2025\.

Regarding commission compositions, the IFSC mandates diverse representation, including athletes, to foster balanced decision-making. The Governance Commission, chaired by Sarah Umbricht (Switzerland) with members like Karen Powell (Australia) and athlete rep Frederik Leys, advises on regulatory frameworks and good governance principles per ASOIF directives. Changes to commission structures, such as adding members or altering terms, require Executive Board approval under Terms of Reference. Athlete reps ensure para climbers are represented across bodies, with cross-over like Leys serving multiple roles.

Competition regulations for 2025 emphasize safety and fairness, with no explicit para-specific sections in general rules but adaptable for local events. National federations can modify non-substantive elements with IFSC approval, while safety petitions (signed by three team managers) address urgent issues. Athlete rights include equipment responsibilities, prohibitions on interference, and appeal rights for judging errors within time limits.

To deepen understanding, consider the collaborative nature of changes: for example, the 2025 rule adjustments involved five technical commissions and athletes, highlighting how para reps can leverage similar analyses for targeted improvements. If broader governance shifts are needed, like enhancing para representation in the Executive Board, proposals go through the Governance Commission for review against universal good governance principles.
