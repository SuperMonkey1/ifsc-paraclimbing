IFSC Strategic Plan 
 
Revised after the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games due to COVID-19 outbreak 
 
The Olympic Dream was the goal at the centre of the foundation of the IFSC, driven by the 
belief that the values of climbing are aligned with the values of Olympism. Climbers naturally 
identify with universal fundamental principles of respect and support towards others as well 
as towards the environment, in an endeavour to blend sport, education, and social 
responsibility creating an all-encompassing way of life. In our competitions we create our 
landscapes, we design our lines, we mould our holds and we unleash a new freedom to 
explore the power of verticality and invent a way of climbing bounded only by our 
imagination. 
 
The impact of the inclusion of Sport Climbing in the programme of the XXXII Olympiad of 
Tokyo, officially announced by the IOC on 3rd August 2016, has been greatly noticed in the 
past few years. 
 
Both the sport and the community have evolved at a rapid pace, and the IFSC has been 
focused on keeping our athletes at the centre of the debate, in an effort to maintain the 
sport’s fundamental features of integrity, openness, and inclusivity, and at the same time 
inspire a new generation of sportspeople. The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in early 
2020 caused the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games to 2021. Nevertheless, 
following the Tokyo Games, the Sport Climbing community as a whole will enter a new era, 
in which the IFSC – as the international governing body – will be the leader in maintaining 
and promoting the values of Sport Climbing, in keeping the community united, and in growing 
the sport globally.

Strategic Planning Timeline 
 
The Strategic Planning phase took most of 2019, through milestones such as the 2019 Plenary 
Assembly, the Arco NFs Workshop, and first ever Climbing Summit in Torino. 
 
In these occasions the IFSC Executive Board presented the vision, mission and key objectives, 
gathering feedback and input from its main stakeholders: member federations. 
In November 2020, during the XVI Plenary Assembly, the Executive Board will present the 
strategic plan to IFSC Members.

Key objectives 
In August 2021, Sport Climbing will make its Olympic debut in the programme of the XXXII 
Olympiad. For the first time in history, Sport Climbing will be visible to and viewed by billions 
of people. 
 
The IFSC will deliver the Sport Climbing event with 20 female athletes and 20 male athletes 
competing in the Combined format (one set of medals per gender). 
 
Being successful at the Tokyo Games means receiving positive feedback from the audience, 
and also being awarded a positive evaluation from the IOC based on the performance of Sport 
Climbing in terms of viewership, social media presence, sport presentation, and event 
management, to name a few. 
 
In the meanwhile, the Organising Committee of Paris 2024 is already looking ahead, and 
presented a new programme for Sport Climbing to the IOC. This was provisionally approved, 
and will receive final confirmation in December 2020. The programme proposed for Paris 
consists in the increase from one to two sets of medals per gender (one for Speed and one 
for Boulder & Lead), meaning an increase in the number of qualified athletes, from 40 to 72. 
For the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, the goal is to reach three sets of medals per gender, 
one per discipline, with the consequent increase of qualified athletes, and aim to be part of 
the Paralympic Games with a certain number of medals and categories.

5. Promote Sport Climbing Globally 
 
As any organisation, the IFSC needs to build a solid marketing strategy and plan to sustain its 
activities and reinvest those resources in sport development, events, and the general growth 
of the sport, thus fulfilling its goals. Although aiming at becoming part of the Olympic
