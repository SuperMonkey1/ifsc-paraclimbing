IFSC WORLD RANKING 
PARA CLIMBING  
 
1. 
Introduction and glossary 
In 2025, the IFSC will introduce for the first time the IFSC Para Climbing World Ranking. The principles which regulate the IFSC Para 
Climbing World Ranking are outlined in the chapter below. The World Ranking Regulation shall be always read in conjunction with 
Para Climbing Competition Regulation, available on the IFSC website.  
IFSC Events = IFSC Para Climbing World Championships and IFSC Para Climbing World Cup(s) 
 
2. 
World Ranking principles 
2.1. Each athlete will only appear in one Sport Class ranking. Athletes are not eligible for multiple Sport Classes rankings  
2.2. The World Ranking will include the IFSC Para Climbing World Cups and IFSC Para Climbing World Championships 
2.3. The points that will be awarded to the athletes are displayed in Table 1. Table 1 will be used for the IFSC Para Climbing 
World Championships and any IFSC Para Climbing World Cup. For the avoidance of doubts, all IFSC Events will release 
the same amount of points to the winner 
2.4. Where two or more competitors have the same placing (ranking) in the General Result of a competition, the ranking 
points awarded to each tied competitor will be averaged for the tied places 
2.5. The World Ranking will include the sum of points achieved by the athletes for the last six (6) consecutive IFSC Events. It 
should be noted that the ranking is not connected to the six last individual results, but to the six last IFSC Events.  
2.6. For the avoidance of doubts, the event number counts will not take into consideration if an athlete attended the event, 
or not. Example:  
 
Total

2.7. The number of Sport Classes which will be open on each IFSC Event will be irrelevant for Ranking purposes. All IFSC 
Events, irrespectively of the number of Sport Classes open, will be considered for the calculation above  
2.8. The Sport Classes which do not meet the minimum registration requirements will not award any ranking points. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the Sport Class which will be combined into another one will not award any ranking points 
2.9. For World Ranking purposes, the ranking of Combined Sport Classes will be re-calculated to consider only the athletes 
from the Sport Class which meet the minimum registration requirements
