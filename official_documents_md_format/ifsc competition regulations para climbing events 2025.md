GENERAL 
1.1 
The IFSC may approve the organisation of: 
A) 
an annual cup series with up to 8 competitions in the top-rope discipline (the Para Climbing 
World Cup). 
B) 
a bi-annual championship competition in the top-rope discipline (the Para Climbing World 
Championship). 
1.2 
Each competition must include events for both men’s and women’s categories and may, at the 
discretion of the IFSC, include mixed-category events (§1.7).1  
1.3 
The IFSC will issue a preliminary Event Information Sheet not less than 60 days in advance of the 
competition confirming its location, registration deadline and arrangements as described in §6. The 
registration deadline should not be less than 30 days prior to the first day of the competition. 
1.4 
Each national federation will be entitled to enter a team per the quota regulations published by the 
IFSC for the relevant year, provided that the federation is not in default of: 
A) 
any regulation governing financial obligations to the IFSC, 
B) 
any decision, or required action, under the IFSC Disciplinary Rules, 
All team members must hold an International Licence. 
1.5 
If a country has more than one national federation, the federations concerned will only be eligible 
to enter one nationally agreed team within the published quota. 
Minimum Registration Requirements 
1.6 
No event will be scheduled or held for a Sport Class where, at the registration deadline, the number 
of national federations and competitors registered for that event having a Sport Class Confirmed 
or Sport Class Review with Fixed Review Date status is lower than the numbers set out in Table 1 
(the minimum registration requirement):2

Table 1 – Minimum Registration Requirement 
1.7 
If at the registration deadline the minimum registration requirement is not satisfied for an event, 
the IFSC may propose either: 
A) 
a Combined Class Event, following the principles set out in Annex A, or  
B) 
in respect of the AL1 Sport Class only, a mixed-category event (i.e., with men and women 
competing together).  
1.8 
Where a mixed-category event or Combined Class Event is proposed, the national federations 
affected will have 10 days to re-confirm participation. If, at the end of this time, the minimum 
registration requirements are not satisfied for the proposed mixed-category event or Combined 
Class Event, the event will be cancelled. 
1.9 
A finalised Event Information Sheet identifying confirmed individual Sport Class events, mixed-

category events and/or Combined Class Events will be issued not less than 15 days prior to the first 
day of the competition. 
Registration Fees 
1.10 Registration fees payable by a national federation will be calculated from the number of persons 
registered at the registration deadline, amended only by withdrawals where a mixed-category or a 
Combined Class Event is proposed following that date. 
1.11 National federations must comply with any reasonable request from the IFSC or event organiser to 
provide contact information (such as accommodation details, scheduled dates/times of arrival and 
departure) for all team members.

NOTES AND GUIDANCE 
 
1  
[1.2] The IFSC policy statement on Gender Identity and Transsexuality sets out the basis for the 
participation of Trans Persons in either category. 
2  
[1.6] Athletes not having a Sport Class Confirmed or Sport Class Review with Fixed Review Date 
status at the registration date for a competition may compete in the event in whichever Sport Class 
they are subsequently confirmed or for which a mixed-category or Combined Class Event has been 
organised. An athlete confirmed into a Sport Class for which an event has not been organised will 
be ineligible to compete. 
3  
[3.2] The IFSC Medical Commission recommends that a team’s medical staff include a medical 
doctor, ideally a sports medicine doctor. 
4  
[4.2] The Jury President may permit members of a team’s medical staff to enter a Call Zone to assist 
in the treatment of an injured athlete. 
 
[4.2] Any area provided for the use of team officials during a round (i.e. coaches zone/corridor) is 
considered part of the Competition Area. 
5  
Climbers are permitted to bring personal belongings such as bags/rucksacks or other luggage, 
battery-powered fans, spare/street clothing, etc. into the Call Zone. The Jury President may 
withdraw permission where such articles would inconvenience other climbers. 
6  
[6.2] In exceptional circumstances only (e.g. strikes, traffic delay), alternative confirmation 
methods, such as SMS or email to the Event Delegate, may be accepted. 
7  
[7.6] The starting order and any Fixed or NET times on the Official Start List will not be changed. No 
substitute/replacement competitors will be advanced.

A-1 
ANNEX A – COMBINED CLASS EVENTS 
1 
GENERAL 
1.1 
Given the purpose, principles, and rationale behind classification, it follows that athletes should be 
grouped for competition only with athletes from the same Sport Class to ensure fair and meaningful 
competition. This is not always be possible in practice (for example, where there are an insufficient 
number of athletes within a single Sport Class to ensure that an event remains viable). 
Consequently, in certain circumstances, the IFSC may propose to allow athletes with different Sport 
Classes to compete against each other in Combined Class Events.  
1.2 
The IFSC acknowledges the general principles for Combined Class Events set out by the 
International Paralympic Committee. In particular, the IFSC may propose Combined Class Events to 
provide opportunity for participation competition. However Combined Class Events should not be 
used where they would create a structural bias between the participating athletes.  
 
2 
PRINCIPLES 
2.1 
The IFSC may propose Combined Class Events where a Sport Class does not meet the Minimum 
Registration Requirements of Annex B, and where: 
A) 
the relevant Sport Classes would normally or typically compete on common routes. The 
underlying point here is not principally the grade or difficulty of the routes, but rather that 
their design is impairment-agnostic. 
B) 
all Sport Classes being combined would be invalid in the absence of a Combined Class Event. 
The purpose here being to provide opportunity for participation to athletes who would 
otherwise lose that opportunity in the absence of a Combined Class Event.1   
C) 
the higher impairment Sport Class being combined would be invalid in the absence of a 
Combined Class Event. The underlying rationale here is to allow athletes who would 
otherwise be unable to participate the choice to ‘compete upward’ against athletes with 
reduced impairments.2 
2.2 
Combined Class Events may not be proposed where: 
A) 
the relevant Sport Classes have different functional impairments, regardless as to whether 
the Sport Classes typically compete on common routes. e.g. A Combined Class Event 
grouping athletes with a Visual Impairment together with athletes with Range/Power 
impairments is not permitted. 
B) 
only the lower impairment Sport Class would be invalid in the absence of a Combined Class 
Event. In this case, the creation of a Combined Class Event would impose an unnecessary 
competitive disadvantage on the [lower] Sport Class being grouped.3

ANNEX B – TOP-ROPE EVENTS (PARA CLIMBING) 
1 
GENERAL 
1.1 
Top-rope events take place on purpose-designed, artificial climbing walls having a minimum width 
of 3 meters for each route on the wall. The height of the wall will not be less than 12m. 
1.2 
Competitors attempt to climb routes belayed from below, secured by clipping the rope through a 
series of quickdraws during their attempt.

including any competitors tied in the last qualifying position.  
2.4 
Where relevant, competitors will be seeded for an event using their World Ranking. 
 
3 
SAFETY 
3.1 
Each competitor will be secured using either: 
A) 
a single rope pre-clipped through a single quickdraw at the top of the route; or 
B) 
two ropes pre-clipped through two separate anchors on the route, one of which will be the 
anchor at the top of the route. The second anchor will be positioned to limit any pendulum 
effect should the climber fall on the lower part of the route. 


---

 
 
B-2 
3.2 
Competitors are not permitted to unclip any anchor on a route. 
3.3 
Each climbing rope will be controlled from the ground by 1 belayer for each rope.2  
3.4 
The Jury President may also require a “spotter” to provide added security for the lower part of the 
route.3 
 
4 
COMPETITION ORGANISATION 
General 
4.1 
Competitors must report to the warm-up area by any closing time stated on the Official Start List 
for the round. Competitors who are not present in the warm-up area at this time will not be eligible 
to start and will be marked as DNS. 
4.2 
Where a route is to be attempt on-sight, competitors must remain in the warm-up area until called 
for observation, presentation or to climb. Competitors (including team officials designated as sight 
guides for athletes competing in the B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes) who leave the warm-up area 
without permission will not be eligible to start and will be marked as DNS.  
4.3 
If the number of starters is greater than 22, the route will be cleaned at evenly distributed intervals. 
The interval should not exceed 20 and must not exceed 22 competitors. Cleaning intervals will be 
marked on the Official Start List.  
4.4 
Each competitor must start in the order set out on the Official Start List. Where a round includes 
more than one route, each competitor will be entitled to a minimum time gap of not less than 50 
minutes between the completion of their attempt on one route and the start of their attempt on 
the next.  
4.5 
Where consecutive rounds of an event take place on the same day, there must be a minimum time 
gap of 2 hours between the publication of the Official Results for the round and the Start of Play 
for the next round. 
4.6 
The Final round should be preceded by a presentation of the finalists. 
Route Previews/Observation 
4.7 
If route is to be attempted flash, a route demonstration will be made available at least 60 minutes 
prior to the scheduled Start of Play either as a video recording made available for individual 
download/streaming (or as an alternative, continuously played back in the warm-up area) or where 
video recordings cannot be provided, as a live demonstration.4 
4.8 
If a route is to be attempted on-sight, a 6-minute collective observation period will be held. Team 
officials are not allowed to take part in any collective observation. Competitors may, before 
entering the warm-up area, make limited observation of the route from areas open to the public.5  
4.9 
Team officials designated as sight guides for athletes competing in the B1, B2 or B3 Sport Classes 
are allowed to take part in any collective observation period for those sport classes. Team officials 
designated as sight guides must be individually paired with climbers. i.e., they cannot guide 


---

 
 
B-3 
multiple climbers where a route is attempted on-sight. 
4.10 The Jury President will arrange for images of the route to be placed in the warm-up area when it 
opens. Only images of the route provided by the event organiser and approved by the Jury 
President may be brought into the warm-up area. 
Organisation of attempts 
4.11 Each competitor will report to the Call Zone for final preparation ahead of their attempt in the order 
set out in the Official Start List for the route. A competitor not in the Call Zone at the relevant time 
will not be entitled to climb and will be marked DNS on the route6. 
4.12 Prior to a competitor entering the Field of Play and/or starting their attempt, the belayer must 
check that the climbing rope is coiled or arranged in a manner without kinks or knots, the 
competitor’s harness is properly fastened; and the rope is securely connected to the competitor’s 
harness using a Figure 8 knot with an added safety knot. 
4.13 On entering the Field of Play, each competitor will be entitled to a period of 40 seconds for 
individual route observation and to complete final preparation ahead of making their attempt on 
the route. 
4.14 The belayer must ensure that the competitor is not hindered in any way by the rope being either 
too tight or too loose, any fall is stopped in a dynamic and safe manner, and the competitor is safely 
lowered to the ground at the end of their attempt. 
 
5 
SCORING 
5.1 
A Scoring Topo will be prepared by the Head Routesetter in consultation with the on-field officials 
before the start of each round. Scoring holds and values will be annotated on this topo, which may 
not be changed or amended following the Start of Play but may be varied where multiple Sport 
Classes share a common route.7 Only holds used by either hand will be considered for scoring 
purposes. The Scoring Topo: 
A) 
may be made public after the closing time for the warm-up area,8 
B) 
should be distributed to team officials with Appeal Eligibility in any coaches’ zone following 
the end of any collective observation period and/or prior to the Start of Play.  
5.2 
The scoring of top-rope attempts for para climbing follows the IFSC Competition Rules, other than 
in respect of the determination of successful attempt since the final anchor on the route is pre-
clipped. A top-rope attempt will be ruled successful if a climber Controls the marked finishing hold 
with a single hand and having done so: 
A) 
achieves a stable position before the climbing time expires, and 
B) 
either performs some action common to the sport or Controls the marked finishing hold long 
enough to do so.9 
 
6 
TIMING 


---

 
 
B-4 
6.1 
A timing system should be used in the final rounds to display, for both the public and competitors, 
the remaining time in the collective or individual observation/preparation periods, as well as the 
remaining climbing time. 
 
7 
RANKING 
General 
7.1 
Competitors will be ranked on any single route in the following order: 
A) 
first: all competitors who made successful attempt, and 
B) 
second: all competitors who made an unsuccessful attempt in descending order of their 
score on the route. 
Qualification 
7.2 
Competitors who do not start at least one route in the round will be unranked and marked NDS in 
the round. Competitors who start at least one route in the round will be ranked on each route in 
ascending order of the Qualification Points awarded to each competitor (i.e. lower Qualification 
Points is better) according to the following formula: 
QP = √∏
𝑃𝑟
𝑛
𝑟=1

SPORTING & TECHNICAL INCIDENTS 
8.1 
If a competitor, team official, belayer, or on-field official believes that some event has occurred 
which may be (or may cause) a Technical Incident, they must immediately report the matter to an 
IFSC Judge who will determine whether to confirm a Technical Incident. No potential Technical 
Incident may be claimed following the start of the next scheduled competitor on the relevant route.

B-5 
occurred which had an adverse effect on a competitor’s attempt, the Technical Incident will be 
considered closed for that competitor. 
8.3 
If a competitor has fallen or their attempt has been stopped as the direct result of a potential or 
confirmed Technical Incident,  
 
A) 
they will be held in a separate area with access to warm-up facilities to await the completion 
of any investigation into and/or rectification of the Technical Incident and for the duration 
of any allowed recuperation period. The competitor may communicate only with 
competition officials during this period. The Technical Incident will be closed, and no 
supplementary attempts allowed, if the affected competitor leaves this area without 
permission; and 
B) 
the Jury President will fix a recuperation period, calculated as 1 minute for each scoring hold 
used prior to the Technical Incident, to a maximum of 20 minutes. The Jury President will 
schedule a restart for the affected competitor to follow as soon as practical following this 
recuperation period. The affected competitor and any other competitors yet to climb must 
be informed about this decision, 
8.4 
A restart will be cancelled if the restarted attempt cannot affect the competitor's ranking at the 
end of the round.   
8.5 
When a restart occurs, the competitor’s result will be the better of their original and restarted 
attempts.

NOTES AND GUIDANCE 
 
1  
[2.2] i.e. excluding any competitors who are recorded with an Invalid Result Mark for the round 
(DNS, DSQ, DQB). 
2  
[3.3] Both assisted and manual belay devices may be used in top-rope events. 
3  
[3.2] Wherever possible, the design of the route should make such precautions unnecessary, and 
such precautions must be implemented for all competitors or none. The Jury President will not 
consider requests for added security measures by or on behalf of individual competitors. 
4  
[4.7] In deciding which video distribution method is appropriate, the Jury President must consider 
the availability of wireless connections and the accessibility of video hosting services. 
5  [4.8] Enforcing strict on-sight regulations in climbing competitions presents challenges in outdoor 
venues. The integrity of individuals and teams, as well as their adherence to a shared ethos is 
fundamental to maintaining the spirit of fair play. Where the competition venue is open to the 
public or overlooked by a public area, competitors may observe routes/boulders from these areas 
whilst they are open, however the following actions are prohibited: 
- 
entering any part of the Competition Area or any other area not open to the public. 
- 
watching, recording, or making use of any recordings of the work of the routesetters. 
- 
using drones or other devices to gain a closer or detailed view not generally available to the 
public. 
6  
[4.10] The Jury President will allow a competitor not in the Call Zone at the relevant time to climb 
where their absence is the result of factors outside the control of the competitor. 
7  
[5.1] The Scoring Topo may allow multiple holds to have the same scoring value where left/right 
route variations have been created to accommodate left/right impairments. 
8  
[5.1] The Scoring Topo may be distributed internal to the IFSC prior to the closing of the warm-up 
area. The Event Delegate may authorise release of the Scoring Topo to media ahead of this time 
where suitable embargo arrangements are in place. 
9  
[5.2] Actions common to the sport include: 
- 
clipping: i.e. securing a rope into a quickdraw or anchor. 
- 
shaking out: e.g. relaxing one arm while maintaining balance to manage fatigue. 
- 
celebrating: e.g. acknowledging a successful move or ascent. 
- 
chalking up: e.g. applying chalk to hands for improved grip. 
- 
changing foot position: adjusting foot placements for better balance and efficiency. 
10  [7.2] Points data presented on the Official Results will be presented rounded to 3 decimal places. 
11  [7.2] A competitor who has a result on only one route will be ranked equal last on the other route.

12  [9.1] If a verbal notice is given, the Appeal Jury will register the appeal so that affected parties are 
aware that the appeals process has been initiated. The Appeal Jury may begin reviewing admissible 
evidence but must not decide on the merit of the appeal until a written submission is received. If a 
written appeal is not submitted within the required timeframe, the appeal will be recorded as 
unsuccessful (rejected) and an appeal fee charged.
