IFSC Classification Guidelines 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for IFSC Event Organisers seeking to host international classification 
evaluations at an IFSC Paraclimbing sanctioned competition. It applies to classification for athletes with physical and visual 
impairment. 
This document has been drafted in alignment with the IPC Classification Code and International Standards which are available on 
the IPC website under: http://www.paralympic.org/Classification/Code 
Classification is a direct responsibility of the IFSC. Compliance with rules, regulations and procedures is required to ensure that the 
interests of all parties – Athletes, Classifiers, Event Organisers and Officials – are best protected with the appropriate conditions for 
conducting classification. 
The IFSC seeks to improve the delivery of classification at every opportunity and therefore feedback is welcome at any time at 
paraclimbing@ifsc-climbing.org.  
2. 
PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT CLASSIFICATION (PI) 
The IFSC will provide the Chief Classifiers and Classifiers, with a minimum of 1 panel per competition in which classification will take 
place. One panel is composed of two classifiers, though exceptionally a panel can be composed by one classifier in accordance with 
the relevant provisions in the IFSC Classification Rules. 
 
Event organisers shall provide:  
• 
One private room per each panel (i.e. no glass doors/street windows visible from general public) for Physical Impairment 
Classification (PI).  
• 
Check in table with two chairs outside classification rooms  
• 
Waiting area for athletes and aides; where this is not possible, this shall be communicated in advance 
• 
Wi-Fi for IFSC Staff and Classifiers 
• 
Wi-Fi for teams (preferred) 
 
Each room shall be large enough to comfortably accommodate 4-6 people, have appropriate ventilation, and be equipped as follows: 
• 
1 physio bed 
• 
Large paper roll for the physio bed  
• 
1 table to sit 4 people per side  
• 
4-6 chairs  
• 
2 rolls of wide masking tape (5-7 cm) and markers  
• 
6 Clipboards  
• 
Stapler  
• 
Pens  
• 
Spray sanitiser and paper towels  
• 
1 bath towel 
 
3. 
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT CLASSIFICATION (VI) 
The IFSC will liaise with the IBSA – International Blind Sports Association in order to provide the Chief Classifiers and Classifiers, with 
a minimum of 1 panel per competition in which classification will take place. One panel is composed of two classifiers, though 
exceptionally a panel can be composed by one classifier in accordance with the relevant provisions in the IFSC Classification Rules.  
 
VI Classifiers are not directly engaged by the IFSC and thus may not always be guaranteed at IFSC competitions.  
Equipment and requirements for VI Classification are set out in the relevant IBSA document and it is the responsibility of the Event 
Organiser to provide the appropriate facilities.
