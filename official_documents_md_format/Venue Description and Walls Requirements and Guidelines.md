Venue Description & Walls Requirements and Guidelines 
IFSC Event 
 
The document outlines the key specifications and technical guidelines for the LOC to consider during the Field of Play (FOP) and 
associated infrastructure planning of the venue.  
The provided information is subject to further consultation with the IFSC and shall be read together with the latest IFSC rules and 
relevant regulations where applicable (https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/). 
1. 
Key Considerations for Infrastructure Planning 
1.1. Wall Sourcing 
The selection method for the wall supplier may vary, including the options as IFSC-recognised providers (particularly for Speed), a 
sole supplier, or a public tender, depending on Host City regulation when applicable. The supply arrangements for walls and 
equipment can also differ, with options for purchase or rental, subject to the agreements among the involved parties.  
 
• 
Purchase: The ownership of the wall belong to the LOC (or the host city/country). The LOC is strongly encouraged to 
discuss with the IFSC or their National Federation to determine legacy use of the walls in advance.  
• 
Rental: The ownership of the wall remains with the wall supplier. The wall and associated equipment are returned to the 
supplier after the event, or may be re-distributed to the third party at the supplier’s discretion.  
 
The wall sourcing process requires a comprehensive consultation with the Host City, LOC, IFSC, and relevant stakeholders from 
the early planning stages. The LOC therefore must work closely with the IFSC and Wall provider throughout all stages of FOP 
planning, including procurement, design, installation, operation, and dismantling.  
 
1.2. Legacy Strategy  
When planning event infrastructure, the LOC should integrate it into a comprehensive legacy strategy, especially for new and 
permanent venues, to achieve cost-efficient and durable solutions. This approach ensures that the IFSC, wall provider, and installer 
select and supply materials with long-term legacy considerations in mind.  
 
Legacy planning is equally crucial for temporary climbing walls. The LOC should plan for the wall’s use after the event, as it can be 
dismantled and reinstalled elsewhere to serve as a lasting legacy. While temporary wall construction leaves minimal impact on the 
venue, permanent structures may require wall installations to be anchored to the ground or attached to existing infrastructure. 
Therefore, all relevant stakeholders, including the Host city and venue owner, must be consulted and kept informed.  
 
1.3. Construction regulation  
When the FOP and walls are sourced by a provider outside of the host country’s territory, the LOC should check the host city’s 
regulations and legal requirements concerning the process of sourcing and construction permits. This includes ensuring that 
designated local installers can undertake the necessary tasks and bear full responsibility for installation and dismantling operations 
under the external wall provider’s supervision.  
 
1.4. Wall installation timeline  
During procurement and planning, the LOC must consider the timeline for the wall supplier to produce wall panels and shipping 
materials to the event location. Installation contractors can be sourced either by the wall supplier or locally, depending on the 
Host City’s regulations concerning construction permits, provided that local installers are competent and experienced in building 
climbing walls.

Venue Description & Walls Requirements and Guidelines 
 
Typically, wall installation requires a range of 7-10 days, while dismantling takes 3-5 days. However, these timelines depend heavily 
on factors such as the number and size of walls, the number of contractors, available working hours or shifts, necessary machinery, 
adequate loading spaces, and weather occurrences for outdoor venues. As a guidance, the LOC should incorporate the following 
elements into the master schedule for wall installation plan:  
 
• 
Assessment of the ground and analysis of wall counterweight and reaction forces  
• 
Construction of the FOP stage, roof, and other adjacent equipment and facilities 
• 
Construction of the competition and warm-up walls’ main steel frames  
• 
Construction of the competition and warm-up walls’ secondary frames  
• 
Installation of the competition and warm-up walls’ panels  
• 
Dismantling period according to the venue move-out period 
 
Contingency days should be planned, particularly for outdoor venues, to mitigate the risk of weather-related delays in the 
installation or dismantling process. The LOC must carefully coordinate the move-in and move-out periods of the venue, considering 
other infrastructure installations happening concurrently, such as the FOP stage and scaffolding construction, video boards, and 
lighting equipment.  
 
1.5. FOP Maintenance and Cleaning 
The FOP and wall surfaces, as well as the FOP equipment, should be checked regularly before the FOP is used for training or 
competition. This means all materials, debris, repair tools, and construction equipment must be removed from the FOP.  
 
Before and during the event period, the LOC must conduct a re-current clean-up of the FOP and surrounding area every day, a 
minimum two hours before the start of the training and/or competition. Refer to the Sport Equipment List for FOP cleaning tools, 
particularly for weather-related contingencies, to dry the FOP. Cleaning of the Holds, Macros, and Volumes should follow the IFSC 
instructions and as scheduled in the competition running order.  
 
1.6. Wall and FOP Approval by IFSC 
IFSC is responsible for validating the characteristics of the walls, including the wall design validation and technical inspection. In 
particular, the Speed wall must be provided by the IFSC Recognised Speed Wall Manufacturers according to the IFSC Speed License 
Rules. The wall company, IFSC, and the LOC are in close consultation throughout the infrastructure planning process. The wall 
company should closely follow the regulations developed by IFSC and make technical adjustments if required during the project. 
 
The FOP and walls must be approved by the IFSC Event Delegate prior to the start of any training or competition at the venue.

2. 
WALL MANUFACTURER EVALUATION AND SELECTION   
When assessing potential wall suppliers, the LOC should follow these guidelines and consult the IFSC for further details.    
2.1. Safety 
In principle, the company must prioritize the safety of the athletes who will climb on the walls and the IFSC Officials and operational 
staff who are present around the FOP. All climbing walls must comply with the European Standards (EN 12572-1 / EN 12572-2 / 
EN 12572-3) as specified in the IFSC Rules and the IFSC Speed License Rules.  
2.2. Foundation 
The company must have significant experience in producing and installing climbing walls. This experience can be demonstrated 
through:   
• 
Solid financial and legal stability, verified by the information provided by the company or the company’s existing 
agreements with comparable entities like the LOCs;    
• 
Experience in international shipping and a dedicated installation team capable of working globally or with the respective 
local installers;  
• 
Dedicated project personnel for engineering the wall design and the capability to provide 3D modelling.  
 
2.3. Experience in supplying competition walls   
The company must have experience in successfully delivering competition-level walls for international events, including the history 
of their participation in IFSC events (e.g., IFSC Climbing World Championships, IFSC Climbing World Youth Championships, IFSC 
Climbing World Cups, Multi-Sport Games) or high-level continental and national events organised by the IFSC Member Federations.   
The company must also demonstrate its ability to handle the delivery and installation of the walls in both indoor and outdoor 
venues. In the case of an outdoor venue, weather protection must be anticipated during the infrastructure planning.   
The company must list a minimum of three events, and at least one indoor and one outdoor project that is completed and/or 
ongoing.   
In addition, the company must prove its ability to install the walls on a temporary basis – including the plan to install and dismantle 
them multiple times if required – on all types of surfaces (e.g., grass, sand, concrete) and provide IFSC and LOC with technical 
consultation on the FOP stage and infrastructure planning.   
2.4. International profile and project management  
The company has proficient communication/media management and project implementation experience in meeting strict 
deadlines in a multicultural environment. The company may provide further information on their regional distribution channels 
and existing factory locations (if multiple) in different regions or countries, as well as the established relations with a team of 
international (or local) operators and partners. The ability to assign a dedicated project manager to the event is important, with 
proven experiences in the similar level of projects. The preferred candidate is to be proficient in spoken and written English to 
ensure technical specifications and requirements are well understood by all stakeholders.  
2.5. 3D modelling  
In addition to the dedicated personnel for project management, the availability of 3D modelling of the walls will be requested to 
ensure good spatial planning on the FOP and adjacent operational areas.

Wall & Venue Requirements with Discipline-Specific Guidelines  
This section outlines the climbing wall and venue requirements, including key spaces on the Field of Play (FOP), Back of House 
(BOH), and Front of House (FOH) as well as discipline-specific information.  
The LOC should note these specifications may vary based on the scope of the event (e.g., IFSC World Championships, World Cups, 
World Youth Championships), as well as the number and format of disciplines. Therefore, the LOC should work closely with the 
IFSC to confirm the detailed venue plan according to the event’s requirements.  
3.1. Wall Requirements and Guidelines  
Area / Space  
Functional Descriptions and Technical Specifications  
Field of Play - Walls 
Boulder Wall 
• 
Height: 4.5m 
• 
Measured from the surface of the boulder mat to the TOP signage, 4.5m is the maximum height for 
routesetting in accordance with EN. The wall may be higher up to 5m if the extra space is intended 
for the look of the IFSC Event. 
• 
Length: 30m (capacity for max. 10 boulders) subject to the competition format 
• 
Profile: 4-5 different profiles with varying inclinations from -5°up to 45°  
• 
Orientation (if outdoor): subject to season/country, it shall be north or northeast in the northern 
hemisphere; south or southeast in the southern hemisphere. Sun exposure is to be avoided.  
• 
Cover: Wall must be protected from heat/rain with FOP roof  
• 
Access: The top platform shall be accessible for TV operators and photographers to install remote 
cameras. It shall be possible for the athletes to top out in a safe manner.  
• 
Inserts: Recommended to avoid t-nut inserts on the panel (especially on the slab and vertical 
profiles). T-nuts are acceptable on overhang profiles.  
• 
Friction: uniform and low range 
• 
Alignment between panels displaying flatness and no visible gap (max. tolerance 1mm)  
• 
Comply with EN 12572-2 
Note: Wall size specifications are subject to competition format and consultation with IFSC. 
Boulder Wall 
Mat 
• 
Thickness: average 40cm  
• 
Dimension: The matting should extend at least 1.5m on each side of the wall and a minimum of 2.5m 
backward from the most advanced point of the wall edge on the floor in compliance with Standard 
EN 12572-2. However, mat dimension should be adjusted based on wall profiles, applicable national 
standards if any, and consultation with the IFSC to ensure the safety of the athletes. In most cases, 
the matting should be expanded up to 2m-2.5m on the sides, when the adjacent wall profiles are 
overhanging profile, and even vertical or slab profile which could pose safety risks when athletes fall 
or move forward the wall’s edge. The mat design must therefore account for swing movements or 
momentum, ensuring that falls are contained within the matted area for safety.  
• 
Stability: The mat must be installed to remain securely in place under dynamic movements.   
• 
Cover: The mat must be protected from heat/rain with FOP roof. Additional mat tarps must be 
prepared to protect the surface from overnight dust, storms, and prevent water to enter the beneath 
the mats. Possibility to place the look of the event on the cover.

Functional Descriptions and Technical Specifications  
Wall Panels 
• 
Quality: The level of plywood quality should be selected in considerations of local climate conditions 
(for outdoor venues) and the LOC’s or host city’s legacy plan, to assess long-term maintenance needs 
of the panels. The manufacturer must respect EN636 Plywood Classification (EN636-1 Dry 
Environment; EN636-2 Humid Environment; EN636-3 Exterior Environment). Testing and sample 
panels may be requested to minimize traces of the rubber from the climbing shoes. 
• 
Friction: Panels are layered with coating, sand, and paints to provide durable and long-lasting friction 
while allowing easy cleaning. During the wall provider selection process, the IFSC or LOC may require 
the manufacturer to provide samples with 3 different friction levels (low, medium, strong) for better 
assessment.  
• 
Coloration: The painting process must ensure even color and consistent uniformity across all panels 
for a clean and cohesive visual display when the panels are assembled. 
Wall Structures 
• 
Main steel structures: Designing, manufacturing, and installing main steel structures must be done in 
compliance of local regulations. The steel structures can be attached to an existing, self-standing 
infrastructure or fixed to the ground.  
• 
Calculation of reaction forces in compliance with safety standard: The weight of the walls and 
reaction forces that the ground can support must be well studied in the planning, to evaluate the 
construction method. The advance planning helps ensure the necessary materials are sourced and 
thus avoiding unexpected material shortage. As a general reference, the average weight of a Speed 
wall is approximately 30 tons, a Lead wall can weigh up to 75 tons, and a boulder wall ranges 
between 15-20 tons. However, these measurements should be used as an initial reference, and 
precise estimation will depend on the wall dimensions and the materials as well as technology used.  
• 
Supporting structures: Wall design should account for both primary steel and secondary structures to 
ensure they can accommodate necessary interventions efficiently, such as the attachment of remote 
cameras or event branding around the scaffolding. It is necessary for the manufacturer to present 
sufficient technical explanation and knowledge on how the wall should be installed and dismantled, 
and a contingency plan to protect the wall in case of the event postponement or bad weather 
occurrences.  
• 
Lead and Speed walls may be supplied in self-standing structures depending on the wall supplier, 
while the Boulder wall requires scaffolding structures.  
Roof & Covers 
• 
For outdoor venues, the roof is essential to protect the FOP (walls, stage, mats) from heat and bad 
weather conditions. The start of the route and entire surface of the boulder mat must stay protected 
and dry.  
• 
Design considerations include:  
• 
An inclination of 15° in any direction should be considered for rain protection. 
• 
Architectural designs and aesthetics should complement overall venue/FOP concept. 
• 
Design must be engineered to withstand wind resistance based on local climate data. 
• 
Cover: The back and sides of the steel frames must be covered for weather protection and to meet 
broadcasting requirements. 
• 
Roof Integration: The stage design must facilitate the roof installation in a way that supports the roof 
independently or allow partial integration with the FOP stage to reduce structural loads on the 
platform.

Training Wall 
Availability of the Lead and Official Speed wall for training purposes are optional, depending on the 
existing training center or commercial gyms in the host city. The LOC is strongly recommended to open 
their training center to the teams or make the information of existing facilities in and around the city 
available to the teams before the event.  
Look of Walls 
and Sourcing 
(For multi-
discipline 
events) 
• 
When the IFSC Event format features three or more disciplines of Sport Climbing, it is recommended 
the walls are be sourced from a single wall supplier to ensure consistent quality across all walls and 
to minimise logistical challenges for the LOC.  
• 
The look and branding of the walls must be also aligned to achieve the highest level of consistency. 
This includes ensuring a good visual matching of all walls, maintaining consistent quality of finish and 
lighting reflection on the panels. The aim is to achieve the ideal tones and presentation of the FOP for 
broadcasting and sport presentation.

Venue Description & Walls Requirements and Guidelines 
3.3. Front of House (FOH) Requirements and Guidelines 
Spectator’s Viewing Concepts 
Sport Climbing competitions are typically held both indoors and outdoors, with standing and regular grandstands as spectator 
viewing options. Sport Climbing is unique in that the main viewing focal point for spectators is often positioned above ground 
level, and this should be taken into account when designing viewing arrangements. As a general rule, spectators should be allowed 
as close to the FOP as possible to enhance the quality of the guest experience and overall event ambiance.  
The final decisions regarding spectator viewing experiences should be made in close collaboration between the IFSC and LOC, in 
addition to ticketing demand based on market research and the host country’s needs.  
The LOC should consider the following spectator viewing configurations, in consultation with the IFSC and based on venue-specific 
considerations, to determine the best fitting solutions:  
Option 1: Standing only  
• 
The large space in front of the wall is designated for standing spectators.  
• 
While this maximizes spectator capacity, the LOC must implement appropriate safety measures to ensure standing 
spectators comply with local regulations, including fire and emergency safety protocols.  
• 
This configuration is implemented in the events such as the IFSC World Cup in Chamonix and Innsbruck.  
Option 2: Ground-Level Seating with Supplementary Standing Areas  
• 
A single arrangement of seats is complemented by standing areas behind and around the seating sections.  
• 
While standing areas can help maximize spectator capacity, they should be efficiently managed, and the LOC should 
ensure that these areas comply with local safety regulations, including those for fire and emergency situations.  
Option 3: A combination of Ground-level and Elevated Bleacher Seating  
• 
Ground-level seating is provided in front of the wall, with bleacher seating positioned behind.  
• 
This configuration offers spectators the option of close proximity to the FOP (when seated on the ground level) and an 
elevated perspective (from the bleachers). This also allows LOC to adopt varied ticketing prices catering different needs 
of spectators.  
• 
This option is mandatory for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, subject to agreement with Games LOC.  
The spectator’s area may be ticketed or accessible without an entrance fee at the discretion of the LOC.  
Spectator’s Capacity  
The competition venue should offer varied spectator’s capacity depending on the scope of the event and depending on the 
spectator’s viewing configurations, considering venue-specific considerations as each venue differs from one another.  
• 
Olympic and Paralympic Games: A minimum 8,000-9,000 capacity  
• 
IFSC World Championships: A minimum 5,000 spectator capacity  
• 
IFSC World Cup: A minimum 2,000 spectator capacity subject to a number of disciplines and venue considerations 
• 
Other Multi-Sport or Regional Games: Subject to a number of disciplines and its scope of format as well as other venue-
specific considerations (e.g., standalone or shared-venue with other sports)   
The next table outlines the list of areas in the Front of House.
