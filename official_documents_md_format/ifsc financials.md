Independent auditor’s report
To the Executive Board of the
International Federation of Sport Climbing
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of International Federation of Sport
Climbing (the Company), as at December 31, 2024, which comprise the balance sheet, statement of
income and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies
(together, the financial statements).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements presents fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2024 in accordance with those requirements
of the Financial Reporting Framework in Switzerland relevant to preparing such financial statements.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in
Switzerland, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibility of Executive Board for the financial statements
Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with
those requirements of the Financial Reporting Framework in Switzerland relevant to preparing such a
financial statement, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of a financial statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibility for the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of this financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represents the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with Executive Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.
