Awards Ceremony Protocol 
1. Overview 
This document outlines the procedures for the Awards Ceremony. Modifications to these Rules due to different events, venues, 
and/or special local circumstances may be made by the IFSC Event Delegate.  
This document shall be considered by all the stakeholders involved in the organisation of an IFSC event (IFSC staff, IFSC Officials, 
LOCs).  
2. Leaders’ Corner 
During Finals of Lead and Boulder competitions, the LOC shall set up a “Leaders’ Corner” for Lead, Boulder, and Combined Finals. 
[For Speed competitions there is no need for the Leader’s Corner]. 
The Leaders’ corner shall be composed by a set of chairs/sofa to accommodate the athletes, as soon as their performance is 
over. The Leaders’ corner should have a direct view on the Field of Play. Food, drinks, and snacks should be envisaged. The Local 
Organising Committee should provide: 
- 
Adequate n. of chairs for the final in the Boulder discipline 
- 
Adequate n. of chairs for the final in the Lead discipline  
Chairs must be all the same size and shape.

Awards Ceremony Protocol 
3. Presentation of The Podium 
The Presentation of The Podium is mandatory when the Awards Ceremony is not immediately after the end of the competition 
and upon specific request of IFSC. TVs and Photographer can catch athletes’ emotions immediately after the finish of the 
competition.  
Immediately after Final results are published by IFSC Officials, the announcer shall briefly introduce the three medallists and 
invite them to the centre of the stage. For Lead and Boulder, the three medallists will move from the Leaders’ Corner to the 
centre of the stage. For Speed, the three medallists will enter on stage and place themselves to the centre of the stage. 
  
 
IMPORTANT: A volunteer shall properly brief the three medallists on how to enter the stage and exactly where to place 
themselves on the stage. It is important to make sure that the Gold Medallist stands at the centre, Silver Medallist is the right side 
and Bronze Medallist at the left side. The volunteer can use a sketch to show Medallists entry practice to avoid language barriers. 
Once the Results are officials, the speaker will announce the three medallists at the centre of the stage. The medallists are called 
from the leader’s corner to the centre of the stage. Delivering of flowers is not mandatory.

4. Interview with Gold Medallist  
Immediately after the Presentation of the Podium and before the beginning of the Awards Ceremony, the Gold Medallist of an 
IFSC Climbing competition shall go to the Mixed zone for the interview with the IFSC TV production.  
IMPORTANT: A volunteer shall make sure that the Gold Medallist is escorted to the Mixed zone in a fast, yet not stressful and 
respectful way.  
The interview will last 5 (five) minutes; in this time the LOC shall set the podium on the stage for the Awards Ceremony.  
 
 
5. Additional interviews 
The requested additional interviews shall be done and the end of the Awards Ceremony. Requests shall be submitted to IFSC 
Event Delegate in advance.  
6. Awards Ceremony 
In particular cases the Awards Ceremonies may take place at another place than the Competition Venue (i.e. a public place, an 
historical building, etc.).  
Presenters, Staff & Volunteers for the Awards Ceremony  
The LOC must provide a sufficient number of staff / volunteers for the Awards Ceremony. Appropriate clothing for the occasion 
must be worn.  
The standard requirements are as follows:  
• 
One (1) chief to be responsible for the entire course of the presentation;  
• 
Six (6) chaperones (3 male and 3 female) to give medals and gifts. The roles of the volunteers shall swap according to 
the gender the awarding is for. 
Other roles: 
• 
IFSC Presenter: Medals are awarded by the IFSC President or by a Member of the IFSC Executive Board. In their 
absence, the Event Delegate will consult with the IFSC staff on site to determine who will be in charge of the ceremony 
and act accordingly. 
• 
Local Presenter: The LOC can arrange for one (and one only) commemorative gift for the athletes to be handed over by 
a Local Presenter, who can be either a representative of the National Federation hosting the event or a representative 
of the LOC.  
The LOC must provide personnel to:

Awards Ceremony Protocol 
Awards Ceremony podium 
The LOC is expected to provide an appropriate Awards Ceremony podium as per IFSC Graphic Charter. No advertising, other than 
what approved by IFSC, is allowed on the Awards Ceremony podium.  
It is compulsory to display the IFSC backdrop behind the Awards Ceremony podium, as per the disposition of the Graphic Charter.  
It is desirable to decorate the area designated for the Awards Ceremony with carpeting and plants or flowers when possible. 
The Awards Ceremony podium must be set up so that from the winners’ perspective located in the centre, the second place will 
be positioned on their right-hand side and the third place will be positioned on their left-hand side.  
 
 
National anthems and music accompaniment  
The national anthems must be played in full within one minute 30 seconds. If for some reason this is not possible the national 
anthem must be faded out after this time respecting the musical sequence. (Appendix II) 
A list of march-in and march-out music is provided from IFSC to the LOC. (Appendix III) 
The time allocated to march-in and march-out should be as short as possible, but not longer than 30 seconds.

Awards Ceremony Protocol 
Lighting  
The LOC should ensure that the area set-up for the Awards Ceremony has sufficient lighting for photographers and television.  
There are several ratios that describe uniformity over a set of measurement grids.  
The main ratios are used to control the occurrence of hot spots over the filming area (minimum/maximum and 
minimum/average) and to ensure that correct modelling light is available (vertical : horizontal).  
The following list illustrates a typical requirement for a broadcast quality lighting system. Note that the list is generic and must 
be considered as an example and not mandatory requirements. Higher targets and narrower tolerances may be required.* 
• 
Minimum maintained vertical illuminance on grid in 4 directions > 1400 lux  
• 
Uniformity (min:avg) >0.7  
• 
Ratio of vertical to horizontal illuminance >1:2  
• 
Uniformity(min:avg)>0.8  
• 
Uniformity gradient<5%over1m  
• 
Glare (GR) <35 (indoor venue) or 40 (outdoor event)  
• 
Flicker factor<1% (flicker free)  
• 
Colour rendering Ra>90withR9>50, TLCI >85  
• 
Colour temperature 5000-6000Kwith fixtures within 10 mired  
• 
Spectator spill lighting on 12 rows <25% of average illuminance on FOP

Announcer’s text  
The script to be used by the announcer during the Awards Ceremony is compulsory and must be studied carefully in order to 
avoid errors. The script is included in Appendix I.  
The Awards Ceremony must be presented in English and, additionally, can be presented in the Organising Federation’s native 
language.  
Rehearsal  
The Event Delegate is responsible for arranging for a rehearsal of the Awards Ceremony and for briefing volunteers, presenters, 
and the venue speaker of the protocol. The Event Delegate will brief the athletes regarding the protocol and in case of 
impossibility to do so, will delegate someone to do so on their behalf.  
At the conclusion of each competition all medallists shall assemble in the ‘holding area’.

Awards Ceremony Protocol 
IFSC Awards Ceremony – Protocol  
I. 
All to assemble in the “Holding Area” and line up 
Immediately after the competitions, medallists, presenters, and volunteers must assemble and line up in the designated area for 
the march-in. This area must be communicated in advance by the LOC staff to the IFSC Event Delegate.  
 
All medallists shall wear their Team Uniform (with closed shoes and, preferably, long trousers). No sport equipment (i.e. climbing 
shoes…) or accessories must be brought to the Awards Ceremony.  
No personal accessories, including but not limited to mobile phones, watches, water bottles, national flags, and point of view 
camera devices, are permitted during the Awards Ceremony; this is valid for medallists, presenters, and volunteers. 
II. 
Entry on stage 
The athlete chaperone enters the podium area first, followed by the athletes, tray bearers and the presenters. If feasible, all 
parties may march in together in order to save time.  
The presenters must march in as follows: 3rd place, 1st place, 2nd place. Depending on the presenters’ positions on the floor 
area, the reverse order may be used as follows: 2nd place, 1st place, 3rd place. The marching-in will begin with the start of the 
music. 
Once the medallists, presenters and chaperones are positioned on the stage, the Ceremony officially starts, at this time the 
speaker shall follow the script (according to Appendix I).  
The medallists shall position themselves behind the relevant podium.

III. 
Bronze medallist awarding 
When the announcer says: ‘bronze medallist: athlete’s name + country’, the bronze medallist will step up onto the relevant 
podium. A presenter will go in the direction of the podium. At the same time, the tray bearer will go in the direction of the 
podium. The presenter will then collect the bronze medal from a tray and will place it around the bronze medallist’s neck. After 
shaking hands, a second presenter will go on the direction of the podium, take a gift from the tray bearer, present it to the 
bronze medallist and shake hands. 
 
 
 
IV. 
Silver and Gold medallist awarding 
The same procedure will be repeated for the silver medallist and the gold medallist.

V. 
National Flags and National Anthem 
The announcer will then invite everybody present to stand for the gold medallist’s national anthem and the medallists will turn 
towards the flags (hats must be removed). The flags of the 1st to 3rd ranked participants are raised all at the same time. 
VI. 
Pictures 
After the national anthem, the gold medallist customarily invites the other medallists on the top level of the podium. The 
medallists are encouraged to gather together at least for 20 seconds in order to hug each other in front of the audience, 
cameras, and photographers.

Appendix III – March-in and March-out music 
 
The march-in and march-out segments, being crucial components of these ceremonies, demand careful consideration when 
selecting accompanying music. One compelling aspect that deserves particular attention is the utilisation of solemn music, as it 
significantly enhances the prestige of the occasion. 
In addition to its emotional impact, it is crucial to consider the legal aspects of music selection. The music must be royalty-free to 
ensure compliance with copyright regulations, preventing any legal complications and safeguarding the integrity of the event. By 
being mindful of the royalties associated with the chosen song, organisers can ensure a respectful Awards Ceremony that leaves 
a lasting impression on participants and spectators.
