# IFSC UNIFORM CODE

IFSC UNIFORM CODE
1.
Introduction 
1.1.
The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) recognises that team uniforms are a key 
representation of a nation’s identity and of professionalism in competition. As athletes and officials 
represent their national federation on a global stage, it is important that their clothing and 
equipment present a unifying association. This code ensures consistency, compliance, and respect 
for these principles, providing clear guidelines for teams and member federations.
2.
General
2.1.
Team members must wear the uniform of their member federation when representing their member 
federation in public during the course of a competition. 
2.2.
Each member federation must submit the design of their uniform, or any changes in the uniform, 
for approval by the IFSC before use in international competitions. Applications for approval should 
follow the guidelines set out in Appendix 1 (Uniform Submission Guidelines). 
2.3.
The use by a team of unapproved uniforms may result in financial sanction on the member 
federation. Breach of this code by individual team members will make them subject to in-
competition sanction.
2.4.
Certain competitions may impose uniform requirements additional to those described in this code. 
Team officials and athletes participating in such competitions must ensure compliance with both 
this code and any additional restrictions. 
2.5.
Member federations may place additional limitations on the display of National Identification and/or 
Commercial Markings. Where multiple codes or regulations apply, the stricter of these will prevail.
2.6.
Any technical equipment worn or used by an athlete when on the Field of Play must comply with 
the provisions of Appendix 2 (Markings on Technical Equipment). 
3.
Uniform Requirements
3.1.
Team uniforms should adopt colours or design patterns which are commonly associated with the 
team’s country, or which have a historic association with the team. Uniform designs must be easily 
distinguishable between member federations. The IFSC may disallow the use of colours/patterns 
where these are not easily distinguished from the approved uniform of another member federation. 
Uniform colours must be the same for both genders.
3.2.
Team uniforms must include a long-sleeved top or jacket and long trousers. Uniforms must also 
include short-sleeved upperwear (t-shirt and/or singlet styles are permitted) and shorts. Design 
details and fitting should be appropriate for each gender.
NOTE: Athletes warming up in an area closed to the public are not required to wear team 
uniforms when in the warming up area. 
EXAMPLE: Events held under the jurisdiction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are 
subject to provisions within the Olympic Charter which place greater restrictions on advertising 
and commercial markings than are described in this code.

3.3.
Uniform garment combinations permitted during the competition are shown in Table 1 (Team 
Uniform Guidelines). 
3.4.
All uniform garments must comply with the provisions of this code relating to the display of National 
Identification and Commercial Markings.
4.
National Identification
4.1.
Team uniforms must include on each upperwear garment:
-
on the front of the garment, either on the left or right breast, a National Identification 
marking(s) and/or the short-name of the member federation/team with a maximum total area 
of 40cm2, and
-
on the reverse of the garment, the Country Code (preferred) or the name of the country in 
lettering between 4cm-6cm height and not more than 15cm width. The positioning of the 
code/name should allow an unobscured view of the code/name when the competitor is 
wearing an A5 (landscape) bib. An optional image of national flag may be placed in the back. 
4.2.
National Identification markings may be placed on other garments of the team uniform, with each 
item limited to one marking, up to a maximum area of 30 cm2.  
4.3.
National Identification markings in breach of the requirements of this code shall be removed or 
covered (as applicable) in accordance with the instructions given by the Event Delegate for the 
competition (or the appointed official acting in that capacity).
5.
Commercial Markings
5.1.
Commercial Markings include Manufacturer Identification markings, Product Technology 
Identification markings, and/or Sponsor Identification markings, whether permanent or temporary in 
nature, on any clothing, technical equipment, or a person. 
5.2.
Athletes and team officials may not display any Commercial Markings connected with tobacco or 
related products, gambling, or betting. The IFSC reserves the right to review and prohibit the 
display of Commercial Markings where the IFSC considers such materials inconsistent with the 
image, values, or reputation of the sport.
5.3.
Should an athlete wear two pieces of clothing of the same nature during a competition, e.g., t-shirt 
under a singlet and/or leggings under a pair of shorts, the under garment, if visible, must be clean 
and free of any markings.
5.4.
Commercial Markings may be placed on the front/side of upperwear with a maximum total area of 
300cm2. Any Commercial Markings must be separated from National Identification markings, with 
a minimum 5cm separation.
NOTE: Individual athletes may choose to wear any combination of the garments shown in Table 
1 when competing. e.g. any top may be combined with either long trousers or shorts. 
NOTE: Body art (permanent or temporary) may be treated as Commercial Markings where the 
design/content of the art creates an association with any equipment manufacturer or commercial 
sponsors. 
NOTE: Identifications necessary for safety reasons (e.g. CE and similar non-commercial 
certification logos) in a location that allows technical verification by officials will not be treated as 
Commercial Markings.

5.5.
Commercial Markings may be placed on legwear with a maximum total area of 200cm2. Any 
Commercial Markings must be separated from National Identification markings, with a minimum 
5cm separation.
5.6.
In addition, a Manufacturer Identification in the form of a design mark may be used once or 
repeatedly as a strip not exceeding 10cm in width on any uniform garment provided such use does 
not, in the opinion of the IFSC, in its discretion, dominate or unduly detract from the appearance of 
the garment. The design mark can be placed in the following locations: across the bottom of the 
sleeves/legs; on the outer seam of the sleeves; or down the outer seams of the garment.
5.7.
Commercial Markings in breach of the requirements of this code shall be removed or covered (as 
applicable) in accordance with the instructions given by the Event Delegate for the competition (or 
the appointed official acting in that capacity).
