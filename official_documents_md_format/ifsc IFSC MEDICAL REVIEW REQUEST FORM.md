WHO SHOULD MAKE A MEDICAL REVIEW REQUEST?  
A Medical Review Request needs to be submitted for Athletes with Sport Class Status Confirmed or Review with Fixed Review 
Date, if their impairment and activity limitations are no longer consistent with their current Sport Class.  
A medical review request is to be submitted, if  
• 
An athlete’s relevant impairment or activity limitation has become less severe, eithert hrough medical intervention or 
other means. Examples of such interventions include, but are not limited to botox injections to reduce hypertonia or to 
increase the active range of movement, tendon releases, harrington rods or joint fixations to assist posture/stability, or 
corrective eye surgery; or if  
• 
An athlete’s impairment is progressive and has deteriorated to an extent that the athlete most likely does not fit his/ her 
current sport class anymore.  
 
MAKING A MEDICAL REVIEW REQUEST  
The medical review request must be made by the Athlete’s NPC/NF and comprise  
• 
This medical review request form, completed legibly and in English;  
• 
attached medical documentation that demonstrates that the athlete’s impairment changed after the last athlete 
evaluation the athlete attended; and  
• 
a non-refundable fee of 100 EUR to the IFSC. The medical review request will not be processed until the fee is received.  
The medical review request must be received by the IFSC at least 3 months before the next competition where the athlete intends 
to compete.  
Requests are to be submitted to the IFSC exclusively via e-mail: paraclimbing@ifsc-climbing.org. 
 
CONSEQUENCES OF A MEDICAL REVIEW REQUEST  
If the IFSC, upon careful review, is convinced of a change in impairment or activity limitation, the athlete’s sport class status will 
be changed to Review. Consequently the athlete will be asked to undergo Athlete Evaluation again at the next opportunity. Please 
note, that re-evaluation does not guarantee that the sport class of the athlete will change.  
 
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT MAKING A MEDICAL REVIEW REQUEST  
Any failure to make a Medical Review Request in circumstances when IFSC determines that (a) a Medical Review Request should 
have been made and that (b) the Athlete knew or should have known that a Medical Review Request should have been made may 
result in IFSC treating that failure as being Intentional Misrepresentation on the part of the Athlete (see IFSC Classification Rules - 
Intentional Misrepresentation).
